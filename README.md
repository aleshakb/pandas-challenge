The Py City School data encompasses math and reading scores for 15 diverse schools with varying student populations. The analysis evaluates average math and reading scores to derive overall passing scores, categorizing the data by grade, spending ranges, school type and size.

Notably, overall passing scores are much higher in small and medium sized schools compared to large school size.

Also, the lower spending range per student, the higher the overall passing.

Reading scores are consistently exceeding math scores across grades 9-12 in each school.

Charter schools emerge as the highest performers, with the top 5 being medium-sized institutions. Conversely, district schools represent the lowest performers, displayed by large student populations, expansive school budgets, and scores nearly half of high-performing schools. 

Minimal code was derived from study group collaborating with classmates. This assignment was completed differently compared to previous challenges. I went line by line with some assist from tutor and askBCS to write the code independently instead of attempting to troubleshoot othersâ€™ code.
